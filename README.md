      <h3>Traits of a Dictator</h3>
        
    
      
        
        Every Dictator should posses the quality of hatred, be a good orator, and strive to get what they want. The quality of hatred will help fuel their power and anger. This will help them get stuff done quicker and bolder. They must be a good orator. Being a good orator will help them persuade people to follow them and do what they say. Last, but not least, they must strive to get what they want. That means they never give up and do whatever the have to no matter what to get what they truly desire. having these three qualities you too can become a good dictator (and by good, I mean terrifying).

                                Dictators don’t just come out of nowhere ya know, they find a good place, then they rise to power. One can be a dictator and rise to power if one finds the right environment to do it. One must find a struggling country or place. A place that would be easy to take over  rise to power. The right environment to become a dictator is a struggling country that must have economic problems, political problems, and social problems.

        <div class="carousel-caption">
         
         

        </div>
         <p>The first things that one must do to find the right environment to rise to power is to find a country that has economic problems like a depression, an unstable economy, and inflation. One thing that can make a country perfect to take over is a depression. Germany was in a depression after WW1 due to all the reparations they had to pay. To rise up one must look for an unstable economy, one where one little thing could cause it all to collapse. Then, when all seems lost for the economy, one must come in and tell everyone that they will save the economy. Another thing that one could look for in the economy of a country is inflation, it can be a good thing (for a dictator). The article “German Economy in the 1920s” says, “Inflation reached the point where millions of marks were worthless. Cartoons of the time depicted people with wheelbarrows full of money who could not buy a loaf of bread”(Castillo, 2003). This shows that Germany’s economy was failing and inflation was crazy and this caused chaos in the economy. These things are necessary for finding the right place to rise to power, but there is more.

        <div class="carousel-caption">
        
         
        </div>
           <p>Another thing that one must look for to find the right place to rise to power in is political problems, like an unstable government, an unwanted government, and confused politics. One political problem that one can look for is an unstable government. The article “World War I: Aftermath” states that “Such economic chaos did much to increase social unrest, destabilizing the fragile Weimar Republic”(2016). This shows that the Weimar Republic was weak and fragile and could be easily destabilized, which means that it is a good example of the type of government one would want in the environment that they rise to power. Another thing that one would want is a government that is unwanted and untrusted by the people. With a government like that it is easy to get the people to revolt and fight against the government. One more thing to look for in a government is confused politics. Confused politics are easier for one to trick and overcome. These things will always help one when looking for the right place to rise to power.

        </div>
            <p>In order for one to find the right place to rise to power in one must also find a place that has social problems.  It is good when the place one is rising in has citizens revolting. Revolting citizens help because then it is easier to overcome the current government. It can be helpful too when the citizens are vulnerable. It is easier to trick them and get them to do what one says when they are vulnerable. One more thing to look for in social problems that a country has is desperate citizens. The article “The Rise of Fascism and Nazism” says, “ people had less loyalty to democratic powers. They looked to strong leaders to help”. This shows that the people were desperate, and that they wanted a strong leader, one can rise to power in countries with people like this by being that leader that the people want. That is what one should look for in a country when it comes to social problems.
            </p>
            <p> One could find the perfect place to rise to power in by looking for a country that has an unstable economy and is in a depression. A country with an unstable government and untrusted government also is always a good thing ( for a dictator). Last, one must look for a country with desperate and vulnerable citizens. A country with all things things combined would be the perfect country to rise to power in. It would be easy to take control of the economy, the government, and the people.
            Hah, watch out world!</p>
